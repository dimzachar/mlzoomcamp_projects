* build_model function

I used the following architecture for a CNN model used for image classification tasks. 

It begins with a pre-trained model Xception from Keras Applications, which serves as the base model for the architecture. The base model's weights are initialized with the 'imagenet' weights and its top layers are not included in the model. The input shape of the model is specified as a tuple of values, which defines the size and number of channels of the input data (e.g. (150, 150, 3) for images with given resolution and 3 color channels).

The base model is set to be not trainable, meaning that its weights will not be updated during the training process. The model then takes in an input with the specified shape and passes it through the base model, setting the 'training' parameter to False to indicate that the base model should not be updated.

The output of the base model is then passed through a global average pooling layer, which reduces the spatial dimensions of the output while preserving the channel dimensions. This is followed by a dense layer with a specified number of units and a ReLU activation function.

The model also includes an optional dropout layer with a specified dropout rate, which randomly sets a fraction of the inputs to zero during training in order to prevent overfitting. The output of the dropout layer (or the output of the dense layer if the dropout layer is not included) is then passed through a final dense layer with a single unit and a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a probability value between 0 and 1.

The model is then compiled with an Adam optimizer and a binary cross-entropy loss function, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. The model's summary is also printed to provide a summary of the model's layers and their sizes.


* checkpoint_weight function


We define a set of callbacks for use during the training of a model in TensorFlow. The main purpose of the callbacks is to save the best model weights to a file during training and to stop the training if the validation accuracy does not improve after a certain number of epochs.

The function takes several parameters:

    model_name: the name of the model.
    checkpoint_dir: the directory where the checkpoints will be saved.
    log_dir: the directory where the TensorBoard logs will be saved.
    delete_files: a flag to indicate whether to delete existing checkpoints with the same model name.
    restore_from_checkpoint: a flag to indicate whether to restore the model weights from the latest checkpoint file.
    callbacks: a list of callbacks to use during training. If this parameter is not provided, the function will create the ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, and TensorBoard callbacks.

The function first checks if the checkpoint_dir and log_dir directories exist, and creates them if they do not. It then checks the value of the restore_from_checkpoint flag and, if it is set to True, searches for the latest checkpoint file in the checkpoint_dir directory with the same model name and restores the model weights from it.

The function then checks the value of the delete_files flag. If it is set to True, the function deletes all existing checkpoint files with the same model name in the checkpoint_dir directory. If delete_files is not set or is set to False, the function appends an underscore and a number to the end of model_name if there are any existing checkpoint files with the same model name in the checkpoint_dir directory. The number is equal to the number of such files in the directory.

The function then creates a ModelCheckpoint callback and specifies the checkpoint_dir directory and the model_name as the file name for the checkpoint file. The callback is set to save the best model weights only and to save the weights only, not the entire model. It is also set to monitor the validation accuracy and save the weights only when the validation accuracy improves.

The function also creates an EarlyStopping callback and specifies the number of epochs to wait before stopping the training if the validation accuracy does not improve. Finally, the function creates a TensorBoard callback and specifies the log_dir directory as the location for the TensorBoard logs.

The function returns a list containing the ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, and TensorBoard callbacks.


* train function

This function is used for training and assessing a model with multiple learning rates. The build_model function is used to construct the model using the supplied learning rate, dropout rate, and other parameters. The model is then trained using the supplied training data and epochs, as well as the specified callbacks. The training history is saved and returned as a dictionary, with the hyperparameters (learning rate and dropout rate) as keys and the training history objects as values. In addition, the function returns the trained model with the highest validation accuracy.

It appears that the model is trained using a static graph defined by the train_step function. The train_step function performs a single training step, using a gradient tape to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's trainable variables and applying the gradients using the optimizer. The loss value resulting from the training step is returned by the function.

* plot function 

We define a function plot that takes four arguments:

    history: an object containing the training and validation data for a model, typically returned by the fit method of a Keras model.
    label: a string used to label the data in the plots.
    max_epochs: an integer representing the maximum number of epochs to plot.
    fig_num: an integer representing the number of the figure being plotted.

The plot function first extracts the accuracy and loss data from the history object, and then creates two subplots: one for accuracy and one for loss. For each subplot, it plots the training and validation data and saves the figure to a file. The plot function does not show the figure; it only saves it to a file.

After defining the plot function, the code iterates over the items in the scores dictionary and calls the plot function for each item, passing in the corresponding history, label, and figure number.
